## Project FAQ
#### 1. What is BookBrowser?
BookBrowser is a social media platform which serves as a tool to help users track, curate, and manage their personal reading list.  Users may also view the reading lists of others to get inspiration or suggestions for their next book. BookBrowser offers a tightly curated space where users can discover books without the distraction of others' opinions and ratings, ultimately allowing users to approach a book without any preconceived opinions.  

#### 2. How does it work?
After creating an account, the user will create their personal book list. Books may be added from the search page (utilizing Google Books API) or from viewing another users' reading list. Functionality on a book list includes: deleting a book, marking a book as read/unread, viewing the book description, and adding/editing/deleting comments on a book. The user may also discover others and follow/unfollow them (these might be friends, colleagues, or someone they admire professionally). Viewing another profile will show a booklist (without comments to avoid any bias) which aims to provide inspiration, discovery, and the ability to save to the user's booklist from a profile. 

#### 3. What is the customer problem we are solving?
There is a need for a platform which focuses on providing users with a tool to curate, manage, and discover books in a tightly curated environment. BookBrowser eliminates the noise of larger sites - no advertisements, no sponsored booklists, and comments are only viewable by the user who wrote them. The hope is that all types of people will utilize the site - authors, influencers, politicians, and so on. Users are enouraged to follow people they admire and trust such as friends, coworkers, or someone they idolize in their industry. BookBrowser strives to cultivate a community of users passionate about reading and the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally through literature.
